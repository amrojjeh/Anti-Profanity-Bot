# ProfanityBot
A bot that checks for profanity stuff! (For discord)
The thing is still in work progress so if you see any bugs or ways around this bot then please report this bug in issues.


## How to set it up
1. Download the python script, and make sure that you have the python interpeter. (This script uses version 3.5)
2. Edit the script and insert your bot token where it says `client.run("INSERT TOKEN HERE")`. (Should be the last line)
3. Add the bot to your server and it should be workin' good!

## What am I planning to add later?
1. A way to remove profanity words. (Right now you can only add them)
2. Make sure that only admins and moderators can add new profanity words.
3. Just improve the Anti-Profanity Bot overall.

## Commands
!addProfanity [Profanity] - Add a new word to the list of profanities
