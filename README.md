# ProfanityBot
A bot that checks for profanity stuff! (For discord)


# How to set it up
1. Download the python script, and make sure that you have the python interpeter. (This script uses version 3.5)
2. Edit the script and insert your bot token where it says `client.run("INSERT TOKEN HERE")` (Should be the last line)
3. Add the bot to your server and it should be workin' good!
